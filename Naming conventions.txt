A macro or subroutine name may advertise which registers it doesn't clobber.

Unclobbered registers are prefixed with a backslash.

\axyp leaves A, X, Y and P (processor flags) unclobbered.

e.g.
some_amazing_macro[\ax.value'a.count'y]

This macro keeps a and x at their original values, and accepts two parmeters:
"value" is the A register.
"count" is the Y register.

If a macro or subroutine has no signature, then it's implied that it clobbers all registers.
